# Portable-Keyboard-Layout

by fmate14 https://sourceforge.net/projects/pkl/

Use your favorite keyboard layout everywhere! I learned the Colemak keyboard layout, 
but for example I can not install it at school, so I wrote a portable keyboard layout
program using autohotkey. It doesn't require an install or administrator privileges.

Just copy one of the folders in `Portable_Standalone` and start the pkl.exe file.
